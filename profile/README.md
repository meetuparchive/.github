# MeetupArchive

and read-only archives of projects no longer in use.

To archive something here, simply go to your repository's Settings page (e.g. https://github.com/meetup/<<REPOSITORY_NAME>>/settings) and choose "Transfer", to transfer to the MeetupArchive Github Organization.

To unarchive, just do the same thing but set the owner to the Meetup Github Organization
